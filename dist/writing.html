              Project Proposal for E-Portfolio:
            </span>
            In this project, I used my professor's instructions to familiarize
            myself with E-portfolios and to research and plan for the final
            E-portfolio assignment (the website you are viewing now) to compile
            and prepare an e-portfolio which now records my academic and
            professional achievements. In conclusion, I decided to use Netlify
            for hosting this website. Moreover, I built this website from
            scratch to not only have more control over the design and layout of
            the website but also to showcase my web developing and web designing
            skills

              Technical Writing: Problem Description and Research :
            </span>
            In this assignment, I wrote a problem description with annotated
            list Of references in the Memo genre form. This technical writing
            assignment provided the necessary background context and research
            for the next Technical Writing Assignment which took the form of a
            Recommendation Report. After days of research, I chose the problem
            of the lack of financial literacy among K12 (middle school and high
            school) Ontario students. My intended audience for this project was
            the Minister of Education of Ontario

              Technical Writing: Documenting Solutions :
            </span>
            In this assignment, I wrote a Recommendations or Feasibility Report
            providing the solutions to the previous assignment (Technical
            Writing: Problem Description and Research) in the Memo genre form.
            This technical writing assignment built on background context and
            research that I gathered previously to suggest possible solutions to
            Increase the financial literacy of students. I then used a decision
            matrix to weigh the proposed solutions based on the requirements
            (Inclusiveness, Age-Appropriateness, Relevance and Cost) and gave my
            final recommendation which was to create a Couching program with
            personalized contents and to Including a mandatory financial
            literacy instruction course at every grade level(kindergarten to
            grade 12)
